# fpdeviant

Script to create DeviantArt curations. May eventually be merged into fpcurator.

1. Register a [DeviantArt application](https://www.deviantart.com/developers/) with your account
2. Insert your app's client_id and client_secret in `deviantart.txt`. This is like your account's password; do not share it
3. Open a terminal and execute `py -m install deviantart`
4. Run `fpdeviant.py` or the .bat to paste links easier

Supports individual urls or batches (drag batch files into the console); will look into a deviant's submissions if you input a user's url, but Scraps must be parsed individually.
